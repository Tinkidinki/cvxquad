# CVXQUAD

CVXQUAD is a collection of functions to be used with the MATLAB-based convex optimization tool [CVX](http://www.cvxr.com/cvx/). It implements a new approximation strategy to treat the exponential cone as well as various functions based on matrix logarithm using symmetric cone solvers. This package is based on the paper:

```

# Installation

Unpack the zip file https://github.com/hfawzi/cvxquad/archive/master.zip and add the folder to your MATLAB path.

## Replacing successive approximation
To replace the successive approximation functionality of CVX whenever the exponential cone is used (e.g., when using rel_entr or in GP mode), copy the file "exponential/exponential.m" to the folder "sets" in your CVX installation (you may want to keep a copy of the existing file in case you want to revert to the successive approximation method).

# Example

The following code uses the ```quantum_rel_entr``` function of CVXQUAD to compute the nearest correlation matrix to a given matrix M, in the quantum relative entropy sense.

```
n = 4;
M = randn(n,n);
M = M*M';
cvx_begin
  variable X(n,n) symmetric
  minimize quantum_rel_entr(M,X)
  subject to
    diag(X) == ones(n,1)
cvx_end
```
